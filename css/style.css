/* Add an underline under any link in the nav that is in the hover or focus state.
The “Skip to content link” (the link within the skip class) should have the following styles on all screen sizes
The link is positioned 40px above the top of its parent element (it is hidden by default).
When the link is in focus it is positioned 20px below the top of its parent (so it is visible only when in focus.)


Any element in focus should have a 2px solid border on all sides.
The following specifications are for the default/mobile view:

.container class uses grid:
Three columns: 1fr 5fr 1fr
Gap of 15px between rows;
Hint: review the Inspect Element images for this one

The first child of the container should
Take up  all of the columns
Use the header.jpg file as a non-repeating background image with parallax effect
You can NOT assume that the .overview class will always be the first child.  

The classes  .about, .method, .clients, and .contact:
Begin in 2nd column and span one column
Begin on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th rows respectively. 


The .about-image, .method-image, .clients-image,   and .contact-image elements:
Cover all of the columns.
Have a maximum height of 600px
Hide any content that goes outside their grid cell. 
Begin on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th row respectively.


The .text-block class:
Is centered horizontally and vertically with centered text.
Check your output against the screenshots provided 

The following specifications are for the desktop view (windows of 800px or greater)
Move the navigation so that the nav is aligned to the other side of the window and has a padding of 30px on the top and bottom and 0 on the left and right.


The .container class uses grid with
Five columns: 50px, auto, 500px, auto, and  50px

The .about, .clients, .method-image, .contact-image:
Begin in the third column and span two columns


The .method, .contact, .about-image, and .clients-image:
Begin in the second column and span two columns.


The .text-block class:
Has  maximum height of  250px
Ensures that  any content that goes outside their grid cell is still reachable. 


Validate your code in all views and fix errors.
Tips!
Start with the css file and look for the places you should.
Get the default (mobile view) complete before you start the desktop view.
If your rules cascade correctly, you should have fewer selectors in the desktop view

Submission Requirements:
Upload your code to Github in a repo called hw3_2025.  Make sure to link it to Github Pages so we can see your deployed code.
Submit link in Canvas.  We want to see the deployed page, not the code so the URL should be http://<your-user-name>.github.io/hw3_2025
There is no autograder, but there is a rubric for you to follow.
